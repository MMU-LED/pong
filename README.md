# Pong
This is our implementation of pong in Python for the MMU Arcade 2018 project.
It is being developed to be displayed on a large LED Curtain Display.


## Installing for Development
Requires Python and Pygame. Installing Pygame can be done through pip.    
As its python it should work in any python3 environment.    
Python can be installed into Visual Studio code to provide an editor, allthough it is not a full IDE it seems to work well.    
[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python](Instructions to install Python to VS Code)

Code can be run by pressing f1 and selecting "Python: Run Python File in Terminal" or by right clicking the file and selecting the same option. Ensure you run Pong.py as that is the main file.


Pygame can be installed in VS Code by typing "pip install pygame" into the terminal window at the bottom.    

Note: I have found issues with this, unsure what caused them. Try reopening and selecting environment again, as detailed in above link.
On a personal machine this may mean you need to add pip to your PATH variable. You will probably have to add the python scripts folder to it. Google this. Or don't.
